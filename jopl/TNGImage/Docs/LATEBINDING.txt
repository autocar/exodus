The late binding option
=======================

Note that this is enabled by default!

This option can be used to minimize the load-time of the application. The way
it functions is that libmng.dll will only be loaded once it is needed. Eg. as
soon as the first TNGImage (or descendant), TJPEGImage or one of the zlib
functions gets created/called.

The way this works is through a reference-counter. TNGImage and TJPEGImage
will do this automatically. To use the zlib functions you'll need to put your
code within the following construct:

  uses NGTypes;

  BeginUseZLib;
  try
    ... your zlib accessing code ...
  finally
    EndUseZLib;
  end;

(BTW. if you have a TImage with a PNG/JNG/MNG or JPEG loaded at designtime on
the main form (or any auto-loaded forms), this feature is not for you!)

The option adds a little overhead as the first call to a libmng function needs
to load libmng.dll and query all the function entrypoints. But if you really
want your app to open as fast as possible, this is the way to go.


KYLIX!!
=======

Under Linux, zlib is a separate shared object. The same is true for lcms (if
present) and the IJG JPEG code. Also, as Kylix offers automatic support for
JPEG images natively, the TJPEGImage in this package is not made available.

I have also noticed that with shared libraries a non-existant entry-point will
cause the application to simply halt, without further messages or anything.
This is important if you plan to use this component with any libmng.so supplied
by default on many Linux distributions. Although this is perfectly valid, most
of these distro's will have an older version of the lib, and dynamic linking
may fail without any reasonable explanation.
