1) Copy libmng.dll to your Windows system directory

2) Open one of the Packages from the available distribution (Delphi 3 - 6), and 
   press the Install button to Compile and Install the package.

2a) If needing to create a package from scratch, use the Browse button to select 
    the "RegNG.pas" as the Unit file name to include in the package.  This will
    implicitly import the other required units.


Note:  The component will not be visible on your palette as it is non-visual!
       It provides additional functionality to any TImage in the unit when the 
       "NGImages" unit is added to the USES clause of any other unit that wants 
       to use the file formats supported by TNGImage.


3) Now when you add a TImage to a form and open the Picture property dialog from
   the Object Inspector, the "Load Picture" dialog should show entries for MNG,
   JNG, PNG and JPEG files.
   (depending on the included components during compile!)


Enjoy!
