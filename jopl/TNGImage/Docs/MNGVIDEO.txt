TMNGVIDEO
=========

This component is based on the memory-optimized feature of libmng specific for
playback of long MNG videos. The saving is quite dramatic as no playback info
is cached. However this does impose several restrictions.

- TMNGVideo cannot do save operations
  Nothing is stored so there's nothing to save!

- TMNGVideo cannot be assigned to/from other types

- TMNGVideo cannot rewind
  Again, no playback info is stored so there's nothing to rewind to

- The MNG cannot contain LOOP chunks
  Again this is imposed by libmng as it doesn't cache anything which would be
  required for loops to function in the first place!

- The MNG may contain a TERM chunk, but this will not be processed
  ...same reasons as above...

- TMNGVideo can only be used at runtime
  It has the same extension as a regular MNG, which is already registered for
  the TMNGImage component

  
IOW if you're going to work with this thing you are limited in your options.

Note also that using TOpenPictureDialog uses TMNGImage for MNG files, so if you
point it to a long MNG video-stream it'll be loading the whole thing into memory
which is exactly what you want to prevent with TMNGVideo. So in this case,
please use the TOpenDialog.


If you're still convinced this is what you want to be playing with then here's
some code:


procedure TMyForm.Button1Execute(Sender: TObject);
var MyMNG: TMNGVideo;
begin
  if OpenDialog1.Execute then
  begin
    MyMNG := TMNGVideo.Create;
    try
      Image1.Picture.Assign(MyMNG);
    finally
      MyMNG.Free;
    end;
    Image1.Picture.Graphic.LoadFromFile(OpenDialog1.FileName);
  end;
end;
