=======

All files can be redistributed freely as long as their individual license notes
are met. eg:

- for NGImage.pas you need not worry about a thing. I'd appreciate an
  acknowledgement but it's not a requirement.

- For libmng.dll you should meet the requirements for LIBMNG, ZLIB, IJG Source
  code and Little CMS. Visit respective sites for more info:
  http://www.libmng.com/
  http://www.zlib.org/
  http://www.ijg.org/
  http://www.littlecms.com/

If you distribute libmng.dll with you Application, and you wish to install it
into the user's Windows System folder (which is recommended), you *must* follow
the guidelines as defined in the file LIBMNG_DLL.txt. This file is copied from
the original libmng distribution and is provided here for convenience only.
In case of discrepencies between this version and that in the original libmng
distribution, the file in the original distribution will prevail.

You may distribute the included binary libmng installation file. It has the
same requirements as including libmng.dll by itself. If you want to point your
users to the latest binary installation, please use the following URL:

Linux
=====

NGImage is freely distributable.

Apart from usual Kylix requirements you will also need to distribute
libz.so (1.1.3), libjpeg.so (6.2) & libmng.so (1.0.0+)
There's a libmng.rpm included with at least RedHat7.1; check the RedHat site
for details.

The latest libmng source is freely available from http://www.libmng.com/
