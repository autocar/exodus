When you add a new plugin, export the IDL file from View TypeLib.

When you change an interface in Exodus, update the GUID for that interface, as well as IExodusPlugin, then re-export the IDL file, then compile.

Run vsvars.bat (from VStudio), and in that shell, go to the plugins
dir and run regenidl.pl.  This will regenerate all of the .tlb's for
all of the plugins, with the new GUID's.  Delphi will regen the .pas
files from .tlb's.

Run build.pl
